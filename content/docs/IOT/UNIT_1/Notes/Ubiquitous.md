# UBIQUITOUS IoT APPLICATIONS

## Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved into a **ubiquitous computing paradigm**, where computing and intelligence are embedded into everyday environments. According to Honbo Zhou, IoT applications are **pervasive and ubiquitous**, operating continuously in the background to support monitoring, control, and decision making.

Ubiquitous IoT applications extend traditional IT systems by enabling **automatic interaction with the physical world**, often without direct human involvement. These applications span multiple domains such as transportation, energy, healthcare, buildings, environment, and smart cities.
